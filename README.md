# ccc_cdsa_jul26
This Repo was created for learning "C" Programming and Problem solving and this is done in July 2026 and I was trained by trainer "Nithin" from CCC Company.

Lets Start C Programming
my_first_program.c
---
```
#include<stdio.h>
#define MAX_STUDENT_COUNT 60

int main() {
    int user_count = 0;
    // reading the user given student count
    if(user_count <= MAX_STUDENT_COUNT)
         // do something

    puts("I lovce C programming");
}
```
Explanation of the above code:
int puts(char const*);
---

OPTIONS WITH GCC:
gcc my_first_program.c
The above code will pre-process, compile (syntax cheking, translation and interpretation) and lastly liking and we get the executable (application/program) Note: The default executable file a.exe

gcc -E my_first_program.c
The above will stop after pre-processing. Thus the pre-processed code still human readable.

gcc -c p1.c
Stop after compilation. Thus we get object code. Note: Object code is machine specific/dependent. Thus the above command will generate object file.

```
int main()
{
int num1 = 0, num2 = 10, num3 = 5;
num2++;
printf("Num1=%d, Num2=%d, Num3=%d \n", num1, num2, num3);
++num2;
printf("Num1=%d, Num2=%d, Num3=%d \n", num1, num2, num3);
num1 = num3--;
printf("Num1=%d, Num2=%d, Num3=%d \n", num1, num2, num3);
num2 = --num1;
printf("Num1=%d, Num2=%d, Num3=%d \n", num1, num2, num3);
num3 = num1++ + ++num1;
printf("Num1=%d, Num2=%d, Num3=%d \n", num1, num2, num3);
}

int main() {
    int x = 8, y = 13, z = -5;

    if(x++ >= y && --z != y--) {
        puts("I like to Climb Mountains");
    }
    else {
        puts("I like to participate in Tour De Farce");
    }
    printf("%d  %d  %d", x, y, z);
